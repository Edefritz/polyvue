# polyvue
Polyvue is an polyline encoding and decoding utility based on Vue.js, Leaflet.js and the Bulma CSS Framework. Polyline data can be displayed on a map or converted to the GeoJSON format.

The Polyline algorithm is a lossy compression algorithm that can store a set of coordinates as a single string and is very popular among Mapping APIs. There is a good explanation on the Google Developers Website: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm

It's also hosted over github pages: https://edefritz.github.io/polyvue/
